# Agros
Agros website.


This repository was created by me for the purpose of learning to use Git/Github for the first time, as well as to practice technologies like HTML/CSS by creating a Website for a local Boxing Gym, this is the first project where i'll try to use version control, as well as "Atom" text editor.

Technically, this is the first project that i'll probably get paid for, so it's special.


TODO: Improve this README...


Later (Mid-2020), i will try to add more functionality to the website, but since what it's needed it's very simple, i'll have to evualuate if it's worth it.
