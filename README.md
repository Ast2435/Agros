# Agros

This is a static website i created for a local boxing gym, it has several categories that showcase and provide information about the work they do there, pricing,
location, contact information and social media.

## Agros website.

This repository was created by me for the purpose of learning to use Git/Github for the first time, as well as to practice technologies like HTML/CSS by creating a Website for a local Boxing Gym, this is the first project where i used version control, as well as "Atom" text editor.

It is nothing special but it was very useful to get a first impression of Git/Github, as well as to practice common front-end technologies and develop good programming practices, like responsive-design using media queries, relative units, and percentages, as well as weird things i've never seen before like vendor prefixes.

I also learned how to buy and manage domains, learned a lot about how servers and the internet in general works, as well as an introduction to AWS, since i had to use technologies like Amazon S3
bucket and Route 53 to deploy this site.
